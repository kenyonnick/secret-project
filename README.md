# Secret Project

Made as a multi-axis April Fool's Day joke:
- It's a create-next-app project for some text and a button
    - Note: this is stupid
- Pokes fun at the paradigm of clicking "here" to get somewhere
- assumes you have some sense of humor
- I made it on April Fool's Day which means it has to be funny

Since I never say "April Fools!" anywhere in the site itself, if you're reading this:
> April Fools!
